--If we sent an email to everyone in the results of this

--email better. For example should we include deleted users? Should we send this email to users 
--who already ordered the item they viewed most recently? 

--MODIFICATIONS ADDED

--1) If a user deleted or merged fix the issue ( adding coalesce in the select statement ) 

--2) Do not send an email to a user who is deleted ( adding useres.deleted_at is not null ) 

--3) No need to send notification if they viewed the item 10 years ago ( adding where statement event_time > x amount of time )

--4) No need to send an email notification to buy something already has been bought ( adding a left outer join LEFT OUTER JOIN dsv1069.orders ON   orders.item_id = recent_views.item_id AND orders.user_id = recent_views.user_id)
